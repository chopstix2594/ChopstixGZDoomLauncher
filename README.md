# ChopstixGZDoomLauncher
Launcher/wrapper/frontend thing to make it easier to set up multiplayer games in GZDoom

I made this for my dumbass friends who cant be bothered to learn CLI.

Currently only a batch file for Windows. I might make a bash script later...

**The launcher expects you to have the following WADS:**
* The Ultimate Doom (DOOM.WAD)
* Doom 2 (DOOM2.WAD)
* Final Doom: TNT Evilution (TNT.WAD)
* Final Doom: The Plutonia Experiment (PLUTONIA.WAD)
* SIGIL (SIGIL.WAD)
* Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders (HERETIC.WAD)
* HeXen: Beyond Heretic (HEXEN.WAD)
* HeXen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel (HEXDD.WAD)

Just put the batch file in the same folder as GZDoom and your WADs and run it.

You will be promted for any necessary configuration.

Have fun with classic Doom games!
